# Bayes Basics

This project applies the 14 JAGS models published by Kruschke (2015) to data from Dataquest's *Data Analyst in R* course.

The project is aimed at application of JAGS from basics. This means that all models are written out individually and passed on using rjags (without the use of any high level scripts).

Typical project outline is as follows:
1. Data and motivation
2. Model outline
3. Results and discussion
4. MCMC evaluation
