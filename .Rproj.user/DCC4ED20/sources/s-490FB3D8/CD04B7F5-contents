## Data and motivation
The data consists of the summary results of school surveys and statistics published by New York City and used by Dataquest for data cleaning practice.

One interesting feature of this data set is the apparent difference in the diversity of responses, with teacher responses being more variable.
```{r}
#Visualize the data variability
nyc_schools_perception %>%
  filter(question != "response_rate" & question != "n_responses") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response_group, y = survey_results)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~question) +
  theme_bw()  



```
